# Individual Practice - Backend-End Development 

This project uses the `paasport` and `bycryptjs` npm packages in a React application created using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

This project is to showcase the use of Authentication and Data Management  using a React/Express application stack.

## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
```

## Run the project

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the React app on localhost:3000.
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

In a seperate terminal windows, run the following command to start the backend sever on localhost:5000
```bash
cd server
nodemon server.js
```
